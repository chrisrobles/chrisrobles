# What to expect from me on here

I plan on uploading my **cheatsheets** here and **personal projects**.

While I learn, I like creating cheatsheets to help me fully understand something and to reference in the future. I grab information from multiple sources including official documentation. I don't plan on making them perfect or to teach someone not familiar with the language/concept everything they need to know, but more of a quick refence and some notes on trickier subjects.

I hope uploading them will help somebody! Please feel free to submit pull requests to fix them up / add to them!

## Intro to myself

Hello, World! My name is Christian Robles and I've been programming since 2013.

I got my start in 8th grade, I was in an engineering class where we had to build an assembly line for transporting a wooden block. The class got split into groups for each part of the assembly line and in my group I was responsible for the programming. I used a language similar to Robot-C and I liked how the code just worked. It does exactly what you ask it to. Plus doing an entire semester worth of work in 4 lines of code was pretty cool too...

After middle school, I went to a magnet high school with a Computer Science program. I graduated in 2017 and a couple days after the ceremony I started working as full-stack web developer where I have been since. 

Also after high school, I earned a Bachelors in Computer Science from UNLV. Now that I have graduated, naturally I have begun the adventure of LeetCode grinding. 

Although I took a course on Data Structures and Algorithms, I feel like I did not get a good sense on how to apply them. So, I'm going over each concept slowly to fully understand their use cases and weaknesses. I'm also learning Python 3 to practice them in.

For work, I've also been learning Symfony (PHP framework), both at work and in my spare time. We are using Symfony to build a new internal website to replace our old website that used Smarty.
